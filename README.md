# How to Create Multi-Dimensional Arrays in JavaScript 🗂️

## freeCodeCamp Challenge 📌

We have defined a variable, myNestedArray, set equal to an array. To complete this challenge you need to:
- Use any combination of strings, numbers, and booleans for data elements within myNestedArray
- myNestedArray must have 5 levels of depth
- Somewhere on level 3 include the string 'deep'
- Somewhere on level 4 include the string 'deeper'
- Somewhere on level 5 include the string 'deepest'

The solution and its explanation can be found on multi-dimensional-arrays.js in this repo 🖱️
